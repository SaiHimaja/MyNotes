This simple add allows users to register with their email address and secure password (_Cognito_), log into a React application (user routing done with React Router), view and edit notes, create notes and add attachments, and delete notes (AWS Lambdas, DynamoDB). The frontend is hosted on Netlify, and the backend, well... It's serverless ðŸ’«
